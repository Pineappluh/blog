# My personal blog

This is my personal blog. Hooraay!

## Installation

You need to install the theme: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Installation

But I forked the repo, so use: ```git clone https://github.com/teotoplak/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1```

## How to add posts

```git checkout main```

```hugo new posts/my-new-post.md```

Now paste the .md content of your blog post.

```hugo server -D```

```git push origin main``` 

And done!
